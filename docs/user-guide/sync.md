## Introduction

The Gresst mobile app is designed to work seamlessly whether you have an internet connection or not. This guide explains how the app keeps your data synchronized between your mobile device and the web application, ensuring you never lose your work.

### Key Features
- **Works Offline**: You can continue using the app even without internet
- **Automatic Sync**: Changes are saved locally and sent to the server when connected
- **No Data Loss**: All your work is preserved, even if you lose connection
- **Smart Queue**: The app remembers what needs to be sent to the server

## How Synchronization Works

Think of the Gresst app like a smart notebook that works in two ways:

1. **When you're online**: Your changes are sent immediately to the server
2. **When you're offline**: Your changes are saved in a "pending list" and sent later

The app uses a queue system - imagine it as a to-do list of things that need to be sent to the server. When you perform actions in the app, they're added to this list and processed when you have internet connection.

## Online Mode

### What Happens When You're Connected

When your device has a stable internet connection:

1. **Immediate Sync**: Most of your actions are sent to the server right away
2. **Real-time Updates**: You see the latest data from other users
3. **Instant Feedback**: Confirmations and updates happen immediately
4. **Background Sync**: The app periodically checks for new data

### Visual Indicators
- The sync button in the header shows no red badge
- Actions complete quickly with immediate feedback
- You see real-time updates from other team members

### What Gets Synced Immediately
- Creating new tasks
- Updating existing records

## Offline Mode

### What Happens When You Lose Connection

When your internet connection is lost or unstable:

1. **Local Storage**: All your work is saved on your device
2. **Queue Building**: Actions are added to a "pending" list
3. **Continued Work**: You can keep using the app normally
4. **Visual Warnings**: The app shows you're working offline

### Visual Indicators

## Reconnection Process
